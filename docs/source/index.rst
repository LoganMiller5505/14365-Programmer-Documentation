Welcome to FTC Team 14365 - Summit Knight's Programmer Documentation!
=====================================================================

**Who is this intended for?**

   This is meant for current or perspective programmers on Team 14365 to learn from and use as a reference, written using the 2022-2023 season codebase as an example for ideas and best practices for future years

**Who wrote this?**

   The original document was written by Logan Miller, former team captain and lead programmer who graduated in 2023.

   However, it is also my hope that, as the team progresses, more programmers will be able to contribute and add their own experiences/insight!

   If you want to contribute or have any questions, you can contact me with any questions at loganmiller5505@gmail.com or MillerBoys5589#4424 on Discord.

**How is this best used?**

   It is designed to pair well with the [**WIP, ADD HYPERLINK WHEN DONE**] "tutorial-exercises" project on the scdRobotics GitHub account for more hands on, involved activities to see the code in action and gain hands-on experiences and concrete reference programs.

Check out the :doc:`downloads` section for all the software you need on your own computer to begin programming, with the :doc:`setup` section describing how to setup a project you can then install onto the robot.

Each additional section will focus on some aspect of the robot's control, each containing "Overview", "Examples", and "Implementation" sections.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. If you see this note, it is not yet complete. Please bare with me, as I am a busy college student now!
